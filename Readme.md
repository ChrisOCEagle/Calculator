# Statement of Purpose

The goal of this application is to help me delve back into the world of development after having taken roughly a one year hiatus from web building. I will be using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript to build this simple SPA. I also will be learning to use CSS Grid, a task that is a secondary goal of mine.

## Features

The core features of the application will be addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Once the core application has been built, I may come back to the application and look into adding more advanced functionality such as exponents, roots, variables, and graphing.
